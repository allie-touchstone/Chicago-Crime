# Chicago-Crime
Analytics and Predictions of Chicago Crime 
Project for Su21 (Data Science Programming)

 - Analyzed a data set of crimes from Chicago to find patterns and anomalies in Python
 - Used findings to make suggestions for civilians about crimes to be cautious of based on location and time of year; 
  ex: New Yearâ€™s Day has most reported crimes for any day all year, with most charges being underage drinking
